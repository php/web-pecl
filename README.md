# PHP Extension Community Library

[![PECL](/public_html/img/pecl.svg "PECL")](https://pecl.php.net)

The PHP Extension Community Library (PECL) (pronounced *pickle*) is a repository
for C and C++ extensions for compiling into the PHP language. This web application
is hosted online at [pecl.php.net](https://pecl.php.net).

## About

To learn more how to add new PECL extensions or how to install PECL extensions
using command line tools visit pecl.php.net and PHP manual.

## Bugs and support

Report bugs to [bugs.php.net](https://bugs.php.net/report.php). The PECL project
has a [mailing list](http://news.php.net/php.pecl.dev). More information about
support can be found at [pecl.php.net/support.php](https://pecl.php.net/support.php).

## Contributing

Git repository is located at [git.php.net](https://git.php.net/?p=web/pecl.git).
Contributions to the web application source code are most welcome by forking the
[GitHub mirror repository](https://github.com/php/web-pecl) and sending a pull
request.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:your-username/web-pecl
cd web-pecl
git checkout -b patch-1
git add .
git commit -m "Describe changes"
git push origin patch-1
```

A good practice is to also set the `upstream` remote in case the upstream master
branch updates. This way your master branch will track remote upstream master
branch of the root repository.

```bash
git checkout master
git remote add upstream git://github.com/php/web-pecl
git config branch.master.remote upstream
git pull --rebase
```

## Directory structure

Source code of this application is structured in the following directories:

```bash
<web-pecl>/
 ├─ .git/         # Git configuration and source directory
 ├─ cron/         # Various systems scripts to run periodically on server
 ├─ include/      # Application helper functions and configuration
 └─ public_html/  # Publicly accessible directory for online pecl.php.net
    ├─ css/       # Stylesheets
    ├─ img/       # Images
    ├─ js/        # JavaScript assets
    └─ ...
 ├─ script/       # Command line development tools and scripts
 ├─ sql/          # Database schema and development fixtures
 ├─ src/          # Application source code classes
 ├─ templates/    # Application templates
 └─ ...
```

## Installation

The pecl.php.net is written for PHP 5.6+, MySQL, and Apache 2.4.

### 1. Dependencies

To install PEAR dependencies:

```bash
pear channel-update pear.php.net
pear install --alldeps DB HTTP_Upload-1.0.0b4 HTML_Table Pager Net_URL2 HTML_TreeMenu
pear install --ignore-errors HTML_Form
```

### 2. Database

Historically the database of this web application is named `pear`. Initial
database schema and development data fixtures can be created using the scripts
in the `sql` directory.

To create the database, run `make create`. To remove the created database run
`make destroy` in the `sql` directory. On systems where `make` is not available,
for example, FreeBSD, use `gmake` instead.

### 3. Apache configuration

These are typical Apache directives you need to set up for a development site.
This installation has PEAR dependencies installed in `/usr/share/pear`.

```apacheconf
<VirtualHost *>
    ServerName pecl.localhost

    DocumentRoot /path/to/pecl/public_html
    DirectoryIndex index.php index.html

    php_value include_path .:/path/to/pecl/include:/usr/share/pear
    php_value auto_prepend_file pear-prepend.php

    ErrorDocument 404 /error/404.php

    Alias /package /path/to/pecl/public_html/package-info.php

    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule   /rss.php              /feeds/latest.rss [R=301]

    # Rewrite rules for the RSS feeds
    RewriteRule   /feeds/(.+)\.rss$ /feeds/feeds.php?type=$1

    # Rewrite rules for the account info /user/handle
    RewriteRule   /user/(.+)$ /account-info.php?handle=$1

    # Rewrite rule for account info /package/pkgname/version
    RewriteRule   /package/(.+)/(.+)/windows$ /package-info-win.php?package=$1&version=$2
    RewriteRule   /package/(.+)/(.+)$ /package-info.php?package=$1&version=$2
    RewriteRule   /package/(.+)$ /package-info.php?package=$1

    <Location /get>
        ForceType application/x-httpd-php
    </Location>
</VirtualHost>
```

## Evolution

PECL, formerly known as *PHP Extension Code Library*, has been initially started
under the [PEAR](https://pear.php.net) umbrella. In October 2003 it has been
renamed to *PHP Extension Community Library* and has evolved from the
[pearweb](https://github.com/pear/pearweb) application. Under the hood, pearweb
uses a set of utility classes called *Damblan* (name derived from the
Nepalese summit [Ama Dablam](https://www.summitpost.org/ama-dablam/150234)) by a
lead developer Martin Jansen.

Since then, PECL related services have been moved to online community repository
[pecl.php.net](https://pecl.php.net/) exclusively dedicated to extensions written
in C programming language to efficiently extend the PHP language. Today, many
widely used PECL extensions written in C and C++ are hosted and distributed via
PECL.
