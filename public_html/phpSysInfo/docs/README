CURRENT TESTED PLATFORMS
------------------------
  - Linux 2.2+
  - FreeBSD 4.x
  - OpenBSD 2.8+
  - NetBSD
  - Darwin/OSX

  If your platform is not here try checking out the mailing list archives or
  the message boards on SourceForge.  (PS, I don't know how/want to do a Win32
  port, but I'll be happy to take a patch)


INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
------------------------------
  Just decompress and untar the source (which you should have done by now,
  if you're reading this...), into your webserver's document root.

  - make sure your 'php.ini' file's include_path entry contains "."
  - make sure your 'php.ini' has safe_mode set to 'off'.

  Please keep in the mind that because phpSysInfo requires access to many
  files in /proc and other system binary you **MUST DISABLE** php's
  safe_mode.  Please see the PHP documentation for information on how you
  can do this.

  That's it.  Restart your webserver (if you changed php.ini), and viola!


KNOWN PROBLEMS
--------------
  - small bug under FreeBSD with memory reporting
  - XML will not work properly/validate under anything except Linux and
    Net/FreeBSD The "This is Under Development" warning gets printed and
	isn't valid in XML.


PLATFORM SPECIFIC ISSUES
------------------------
  - FreeBSD
    There is currently a bug in FreeBSD that if you boot your system up and
	drop to single user mode and then again back to multiuser the system
	removes /var/run/dmesg.boot.  This will cause phpsysinfo to fail.  A bug
	has already been reported to the FreeBSD team.  (PS, this may exist in
	other *BSDs also)


WHAT TO DO IF IT DOESN'T WORK
-----------------------------
  First make sure you've read this file completely, especially the
  "INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION" section.  If it still doesn't work then
  you have two options.
  
  1. Submit a bug on SourceForge. (preferred)
     (http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpsysinfo/)

  2. Send an email to the developer list.
     (phpsysinfo-devel@lists.sourceforge.net)
