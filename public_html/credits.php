<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>
 All credit goes to everyone who has submitted and/or commented on a bug
 report, written documentation, submitted a user note, created and/or
 maintained a PECL extension, worked on this website, been involved with the
 mailing lists or IRC, worked on PHP internals, PEAR, and much much more.
 Basically, the credit goes to everyone who has helped make PHP better
 because everything here is tied together. Specific names are available
 within each PECL package but there are also the countless number of people
 who work on this project every day, people who spend large amounts of
 available free time to help make PHP the best it can be.
