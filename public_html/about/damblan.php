<h1>Damblan</h1>

<p>Damblan is a set of utility classes, which we are using on
pear.php.net. Some people might even call Damblan a framework, but we
don&apos;t. For now.</p>

<p>The name is derived from the Nepalese summit
<?php echo make_link("http://www.summitpost.com/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/52", "Ama Dablam"); ?>,
but with an additional &quot;m&quot;. Please do not ask for the reason.</p>

<p>Currently the feature set of Damblan is quite limited, but we are
working towards integrating caching, parsing and sending emails and 
other great stuff. At a certain point there may be even the
possibility to download and install Damblan as a PEAR package.</p>

<p>If you have questions or comments about Damblan, get in touch with
<?php echo make_mailto_link("mj@php.net", "Martin"); ?>.</p>
